# Dynamic-Response-Analysis-of-a-Weakly-Nonlinear-Mechanical-Oscillator
Experimentally analyzed a spring–mass–damper system using ultrasonic sensors and MATLAB signal processing. Compared measured dynamic response with theoretical models to validate system behavior and identify real-world nonlinearities.
